# Travel-With
TravelWith is a Spring Boot application that connects students traveling on the same routes. Users enter their travel details—name, phone no., date, time, etc. and the app displays a list of fellow travelers on the same train or station. This helps students find travel companions, share expenses, and travel safely together.
